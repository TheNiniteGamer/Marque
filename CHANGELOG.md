Updates marked **Significant update** add major features or change how Marquee runs. Settings →

installing one.

## 0.2.0 — Significant update

Commit `8548090`, October 2026.

- **Adaptive streaming (HLS):** a quality menu in the player with Original, Auto and fixed
  1080p / 720p / 480p / 360p. *Auto* adjusts to your connection and is the default away from home.
  Seeking anywhere starts within seconds.
- **Graphics card transcoding:** NVIDIA (NVENC), Intel Quick Sync and Intel/AMD VAAPI are detected
  automatically, with fallback to the CPU. To turn it on, set `GPU=nvidia` (or `intel` / `amd` on
  Linux) in `.env` and run `start-marquee.bat` again. The status is in Settings → Transcoding.
- **Skip intro:** theme songs are found by comparing the audio of episodes in each season. A
  **Skip Intro** button appears during the intro (keyboard: `S`). Turn on automatic skipping
  under Account.
- **Casting:** Chromecast / Google TV from Chrome and Edge, and AirPlay from Safari. Includes
  subtitles, resume position, progress sync and next episode. `start-marquee.bat` fills in the cast
  address automatically; it can be changed in Settings → Transcoding.
- **Android app 1.1.0:** a quality picker and a Skip Intro button. Download it from the Account
  page.
- **Signed playback links:** cast devices and native players get a link that lasts 12 hours and
  opens only one video, instead of the sign-in cookie.

**After updating:** the Docker image is rebuilt with graphics drivers, so this update takes a
little longer than usual. Intro detection runs in the background after the first library scan.
